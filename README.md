Implementation of Q-Learning for a robot that picks items and brings it to counter in an FC
A growing e-commerce company is building a new warehouse, and the company would like all of the picking operations in the new warehouse to be performed by warehouse robots.

In the context of e-commerce warehousing, “picking” is the task of gathering individual items from various locations in the warehouse in order to fulfill customer orders.

After picking items from the shelves, the robots must bring the items to a specific location within the warehouse where the items can be packaged for shipping.

In order to ensure maximum efficiency and productivity, the robots will need to learn the shortest path between the item packaging area and all other locations within the warehouse where the robots are allowed to travel.
